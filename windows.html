<p>before we begin, you need to know a few things: <br> <br>
- you need to have a drive with at least 16gb of space that you don't use. we will use this to make a fresh install of windows on your computer, but it will destroy the data currently on the drive. make sure to backup. <br> <br>
- all of your windows data will be LOST. if you have multiple drives, make sure you know which one you're going to format when installing windows. back up your stuff.<br><br>
- you WILL have to reinstall everything (discord, steam, etc.)</p>

<p>- download windows 11 from this link:</p>

<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11</a>
<br><br>
scroll to the bottom until you see this page:
<br><br>

<br>
<p>you can go ahead and click on the button that says "Download Now"</p>
<p>you'll be prompted to select your language, just choose it and click on "Confirm".</p>
<p>you will then click on the "64-bit download" button. this will start downloading something like "Win11_24H2_English_x64.iso".</p> 
    
<p>in the meantime, you can go ahead and head to <a href="https://rufus.ie/en/">https://rufus.ie/en/</a> to download "rufus". a tool that will let you burn the iso to a usb stick to install windows.</p>
<p>scroll down until you see this:</p> <br>

<p>clicking on it will download a file named "rufus-4.6.exe". running it will show you this:</p>

<p>you can press on no. this will not matter. after you open it, you will be presented with the main rufus interface. once windows 11 finishes downloading, you may insert your usb drive, and select it with rufus.</p>
<br>

<p>here, you can press on the "SELECT" button, and navigate to your newly downloaded windows 11 .iso file.</p>

<h2 style="color:#FF4040">THIS WILL ERASE ALL DATA ON THE USB DRIVE. MAKE SURE TO BACK UP EVERYTHING BEFORE DOING THIS.</h2>
<p>once you select the file, you can click on the "START" button</p>

<p>this process will take a few minutes. it depends on the speed of your usb drive. be patient, and don't eject the usb drive while its writing.</p>
<p>once its done, you have a windows 11 installer on your usb! now the hard part.</p>
