<p>
    yeah whatever website's dead. i'm remaking it once again @ <a href="https://github.com/cookiaria/cookisite">github.com/cookiaria/cookisite</a>! 
</p>
<p>
    will be almost the exact same layout, i just need everything to be more ... manageble, and less sloppy
</p>
<p>
    also <a href="/gallery">/gallery</a> is completely removed because... it was just a bad idea, fuck ai. i'll try to figure out a way to bring it back in the new one in a way that makes it impossible for ai to scrape.
